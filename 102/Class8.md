## Class 8 Reading Notes

*Expressions and Oerators

1 An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves a value, two types side effects and purely evaluate. x = 7 is an example of first = is the operator 7 is evaluated. 3+4 is the seond type.

2 Complex expressions joined by operators = +, precedence determins order
3 JavaScript has binary and unary operators, special ternary operator
 operand1 operator operand2
 example 3 + 4 or x * y
4 Unary single operand 
 operator operand
 operand operator
 x++ or ++x
5 Assignment operator assigns value to its left operand based on value of right operand
6 Expression evals to object, left hand side of assingment expresssion may make assingments to properties. 
7 Destructuring makes it possibel to extract data rom arrays or object using mirror syntax
8 Don't chain or nest assignments
9 Arithmetic operators takes numerical values as their operand and returns a single numerical value

## Loops and iteration
 Quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
 like a game of takes x steps in one direction then y in another

 1 Statement loops repeat until specified condition eval false

 2 do...while statement do 
   do
    statement
    while (condition);
 if condition true statement repeats
 3 While statements
 4 Labeled statement
   label:
    statement
5 Break Statement 
  break;
  break label;
